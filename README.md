# üöÄ Welcome to VeriSage - Real-Time News Verification Platform

*Empower Journalists and Truth-Seekers with AI-Powered Insights!*

**[Live Demo](https://veri-sage.vercel.app/)** | [Deployed on Vercel](#deployment)

VeriSage is an innovative, open-source web application designed for the News and Media domain. It tackles the challenge of detecting misinformation by cross-referencing live news streams with historical disinformation patterns, processing data at scale, and delivering contextual insights to journalists. Built with cutting-edge technology, VeriSage helps you verify breaking news and uncover hidden narratives with ease!

## ‚ú® Why VeriSage Stands Out
- **Real-Time Verification**: Analyze high-velocity news streams instantly.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Simulate AI to detect recurring fake narratives.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Dark-themed, responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- **Customizable Goals**: Set your verification mission and save your work.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and enhance the platform!

---

## üéØ Features
- **Homepage**: Enter a verification goal (e.g., "verify breaking news") and get started.
- **Editor Page**:
  - **Code Editor**: Use Monaco Editor to write Python scripts for news analysis.
  - **Chat Interface**: View real-time insights with a toggle for preview mode.
  - **Dashboard**: Track Verification Accuracy, Data Processed, and Analysis Time.
  - **Sidebar**: Save analysis, export reports, and switch data sources.
- **Mock AI**: Simulate responses with a 1-2 second delay for realistic processing.
- **Local Persistence**: Save projects using localStorage.
- **Deploy to Vercel**: Seamlessly deploy with a single click (simulated).
